# Logbook
[Logbook](https://rostiger.github.io/logbook/) is a personal tracking tool I use to document and analyse how I spend my time.

**Logbook** is a subset of **Anchors**, an ecosystem that hosts an array of personal tools, such as [Chronicle](https://github.com/Rostiger/chronicle) and Lexicon.
Anchors was born from the desire to better know and understand myself and gather data on where I come from, where I am and where I am going.
It is an attempt to store and visualize this data in a single place where it is easily accessible and maintainable.

Logbook is also inspired by the many incredible creatives of the Merveilles community who create and use their own time tracking tools.
